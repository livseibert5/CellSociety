### Issues in Current Code


#### Method or Class GameLoop
* Very long createSecondLandingScreen method, and we decided to 
create new methods to reduce duplication in tasks by creating
  a separate method to set the button layouts.
  

* We currently list out all the XML files, but will create a file
chooser to reduce duplication in the code 

#### Method or Class
* Design issues

* Design issue

#### Other issues
* Final variables were being declared as private, so we changed them to public
static final variables
  
* We removed unnecessary import statements

* We went through the local variables should not be declared and then returned
and provided justification in the javadoc comments for why we felt they were appropriate
  
* Changed methods for isEmpty checking if array list is empty

*
